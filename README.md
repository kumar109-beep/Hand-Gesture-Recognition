# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Computer Vision Project Idea – In this project, you are going to determine the gesture of the hand in real-time using a webcam. 

First, the background is separated from the hand region and then the fingers are segmented to predict hand gestures.  With different hand gestures, you can perform different actions.
